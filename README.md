# JamfThings
A Public Repository for my Special Scripts to be used with Jamf Pro

There is no guarantee that these scripts or tools will work for you, but I'd love to share what I've been able to come up with and hope that anyone viewing these will continue to help myself and other mac admins hone the craft!

Please feel free to take what you'd like, modify it as you see fit, and improve upon existing concepts.
